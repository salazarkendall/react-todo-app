# React ToDoApp ðŸ“š

This project was made to use some React hooks, such as useReducer and useEffect.
Also, I wanted to implement localStorage functionality, that means your todos will be available even after you close and reopen your browser.

## Important

If you want to review the code and use it in your own computer, first you'll need to install Node.js and then, under the project folder, run the following command in your terminal:

`npm i`

Then you'll be able to use this app in your browser running this command:

`npm start`

Don't want to mess with that? you can always go to the [live version of this project](https://salazarkendall.github.io/react-todo-app/).
